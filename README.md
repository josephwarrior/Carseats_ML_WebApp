# Carseats_ML_WebApp
Web App predicting sales, using model built from popular carseats dataset


# What I Learned
-Developed and deployed a Web App that uses a machine learning model (regression tree)

-Built and saved a model for further use in the web app, using python and the useful 
  machine learning libraries, like sklearn and pandas
  
# How it works
Step 1: The user enters 3 values:
<br/>--  the unit price of a carseat
<br/>--  the qualitative quality of the location of the carseat in the shelves (Bad, Medium or Good)
<br/>--  the budget to spend in advertisement of the carseats (in thousands)
<br/>Step 2: the user presses the "Predict Sales" button
<br/>Step 3: the Web App provides predicted sales as a result, for the given input.
